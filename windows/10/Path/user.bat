 Where is my home directory located?
Where a user's home directory is located varies from platform to platform and among the users on a single computer. But the actual location of the home directory is available through special environment variables:
Unix/Linux
$HOME
Windows
%USERPROFILE%
Cygwin
$USERPROFILE
